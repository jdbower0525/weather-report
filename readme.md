## WEATHER REPORT ##


Weather report is a program meant to familiarize us with the process of
pulling data from an API and formatting it in a way that is readable to user.
To run the program, run the <b>pip3 install requirements.txt</b> command to
set up the background functions you'll need.  Once that is done, run the
<b>weather.py</b> command to start the program. From here, you will be prompted
to supply a zip code that the program will look up the weather for.

From there, you'll be prompted for which kind of report you want the program
to print.  You'll have the option of a detailed report of the current
conditions at that zip code, the 10 day forecast, the time for sunrise and
sunset, whether or not there is a severe weather advisory out for that zip code,
and a list of current hurricanes, regardless of where they are.

After printing an input, the program will ask if you'd like to search for
something else, whether or not you'd like to change zip codes, and it will
also give you the option of exiting the program.

This program is only meant for educational purposes.
